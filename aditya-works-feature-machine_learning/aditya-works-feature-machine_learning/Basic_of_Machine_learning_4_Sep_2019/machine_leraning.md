#### What is Machine Learning ? 
* Machine learning : A field of study that gives computers
the ability to learning without being explicitly programmed. \

#### Well-posed Learning (Defined by Tom Mitchell)
Problem : A computers programs is said to learn from experience
E with respect to some task T and some performance measure P,
if its performance at task in T, as measured by P, 
improves with exprience E.

#### Example 
Suppose your email program watches which emails you do 
or do not mark as spam, and based on that learns how to better
filter spam.
* So here,
* T will be the classifying emails as spam or not spam
* E will be the watching you label emails as spam or not spam.
* P will be the number of emails correctly classified as spam or not spam

Here is an some few example of machine learning \
